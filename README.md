# üß† About 

The purpose of this project is to put into practice my knowledges in React, NextJS, JavaScript and API RESTful.

The challenge is to implement a task list with the following functionalities:

- [x] Create components
- [x] Use TailwindCSS
- [x] Consume APIs
- [X] Search for different cities' weather 

## üìã Requirements

- Use Next.js and Javascript
- Consume APIs from https://openweathermap.org/ and https://unsplash.com/

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation

1. create an account on openweathermap and unsplash website to get an "Access Key". 
```bash
https://openweathermap.org/
# and
https://unsplash.com/
```

2.  Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marki1ins/weather-webpage.git
```

3. create a folder called ".env.local" in the application's root folder and insert your "Access Key".
```bash
# .env.local
API_KEY=PUTYOUROPENWEATHERKEYHERE
UNSPLASH_KEY=PUTYOURUNSPLASHKEYHERE
```

4. run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
